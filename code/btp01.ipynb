The map for this environment is a row of 6 grid cells that are colored either green or red and each labeled $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.  In real life, a larger form of this grid environment could make up what is known as an occupancy grid, or a map of the world with places that the robot can go represented as green cells and obstacles as red cells.\n",
